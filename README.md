#Domotic System with Raspberry Pi, Python, GPIO and Relays.

The output port from GPIO is 18 (12 on code). In order to run the code, use the following line:
  sudo python server.py --gpio 12
Note that in this case 12 is the code level port. You can read more about those on the documentation of your GPIO cobbler.
For more information on how to use password protection (implemented) and how to change it, read the original readme.md from Patrick Fuller.
